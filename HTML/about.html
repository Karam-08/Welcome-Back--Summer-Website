            <p>The purpose of this website is mainly to shake off my mental rust. I'm doing this by creating a website with the theme "Welcome Back Summer", which is what you're viewing right now.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also want to show the experiences that I had over the summer. Well, I didn't really do much. I just played Warthunder most of the time. But I did go to Washington D.C, which was nice.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Check the Gallery to see what I did over the summer.</p>
