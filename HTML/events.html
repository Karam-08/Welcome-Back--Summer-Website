            <p>Most of my summer consisted of playing Warthunder. I got up to a 7.7 battle rating in Aviation before school started.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Other than that, I tried applying for fast food jobs near me for work experience. I was either ghosted or denied the job. I had 2 interviews.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the summer, my music taste mainly revolved around one artist. I decided to listen to more artists in order to expand my music taste.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the last month of my summer, My family and I went to Washington D.C with to meet my sister. I hated the humidity, but the food was great.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One exception was a Lebanese restaurant my family went to. I remember it being around $160. The food wasn't even that good.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That's what I did for the summer. Maybe next summer you can play a game, travel, or explore new things.</p>
